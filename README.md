# Embracing-Diversity--Analyzing-inclusion-for-a-thriving-workspace
As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I analyzed an HR Diversity and Inclusion dataset, designing a Power BI dashboard report and defining KPIs to measure the organization's progress. The project enabled data-driven decision-making, provided actionable insights towards diversity goals.

## The Following KPIs were measured to analyze the data:
1. Number of Male Employees
2. Number of Female Employees
3. Leavers and Hired in 2020 
4. Department Level Employee Distribution
5. Job Level Employee Distribution
6. Performance and Promotions in 2020
7. Performance and Promotions in 2021

## Insights & Recommendations:

1. In 2020, a total of 66 employees were hired, with 32 being men and 34 being women. This balanced recruitment reflects a positive atmosphere for gender equality within the organization. 

2. In 2020, out of the 66 employees recruited, the majority, comprising 62 individuals, hail from Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy. This trend indicates a preference for hiring employees exclusively from this particular geographic region. The company's hiring practices seem to prioritize candidates from these countries, potentially reflecting a strategic focus on sourcing talent from familiar cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

3. Women are more likely recruited into lower paid roles compared to men in job level Less than 20% Womenâ€™s are working for upper management job level role.

4. In 2021, promotions saw a ratio of approximately 65% for men and 35% for women, despite women receiving higher performance ratings in 2020. Conversely, in 2019, men outpaced women in terms of performance ratings. These disparities suggest a disconnect between performance evaluation and promotion outcomes, with gender playing a significant role in advancement opportunities.
